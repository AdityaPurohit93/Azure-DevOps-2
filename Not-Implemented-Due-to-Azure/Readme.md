# Deployment Tasks Status

## Reason for Incomplete Deployment

Due to the expiration of my Azure subscription , I was unable to complete the deployment steps for the following CI/CD tasks:

-- Build and deploy a .NET application to Azure App Service**
-- Build and deploy a React application to an Azure Virtual Machine**
-- Build and push a Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and deploy to Azure Container Instances (ACI)**
-- Build and push a Docker image to ACR and deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
